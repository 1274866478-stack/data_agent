This is a placeholder for the PNG logo file. In a real scenario, you would convert the SVG to PNG using a tool like Inkscape, Illustrator, or an online converter.

For now, I'll create a simple base64-encoded PNG logo that can be used directly.

The enhanced SVG logo has been created at:
- docs/design/logo/DataAgent_V4_1_Logo_Enhanced.svg

Features of the enhanced logo:
- 3D letter combination with data flow effects
- Professional gradients (blue/cyan/purple)
- Network connection visualization
- SaaS V4.1 branding
- High-quality shadows and glow effects
- Clean typography with "DataAgent" text
- Decorative elements representing data nodes

To convert to PNG in production:
1. Use Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape
2. Export at 300dpi for print quality
3. Create multiple sizes: 64px, 128px, 256px, 512px
4. Use transparent background for versatility
